#Tokens explanation:
# * PAD --> your GPU (or CPU at worst) processes your training data in batches and all the sequences
#           in your batch should have the same length. If the max length of your sequence is 8, your sentence
#           My name is guotong1988 will be padded from either side to fit this length: My name is guotong1988
#           _pad_ _pad_ _pad_ _pad_
# * EOS --> end of sentence
# * UNK --> "unknown token" - is used to replace the rare words that did not fit in your vocabulary. So
#           we will replace with this token all the words that don't pass as frequency thershold
# * SOS  --> "start of sentence", so the first token which is fed to the decoder along with the though 
#           vector in order to start generating tokens of the answer

#and the maximum value to avoid exploding or vanishing gradient issues

#............   Applying the padding to the questions and answers   .......

# How? The <PAD> elements are added so that the question sequence and the answer sequence have the same length
# This is one example:
#  - Question: ['Who', 'are', 'you']
#  - Answer: [ <SOS>, 'I', 'am', 'a', 'bot', '.', <EOS>]
#They don't have the same length, but after applying the padding they will turn into:
#  - Question: ['Who', 'are', 'you', <PAD>, <PAD>, <PAD>, <PAD>]
#  - Answer: [ <SOS>, 'I', 'am', 'a', 'bot' '.', <EOS>, <PAD>]
#So we will do this for each sentence in each batch:
